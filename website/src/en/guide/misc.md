## Administrator Privileges

Since 10.3, you can set the program to start with administrator privileges.

Advantages:

- OneQuick will also work with programs that have administrator privileges (such as Task Manager)
- When running commands with administrator privileges, the UAC will no longer pop up

Known issues:
- Due to system restrictions, the purchase window cannot pop up under administrator privileges

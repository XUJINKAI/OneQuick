## Administrator Privileges

By using the administrator privileges button on the start page, you can set OneQuick to run with administrator privileges.

Advantages:

- OneQuick will also work with programs that have administrator privileges (such as Task Manager)
- When running commands with administrator privileges, the UAC will no longer pop up
- For items that are not set to run with administrator privileges, OneQuick will still run them with normal privileges

Known issues:
- Due to system restrictions, the purchase window cannot pop up under administrator privileges

## Settings

### Limit Mouse Wheel Rate

Set the minimum interval time for mouse wheel triggering, in milliseconds.

When your mouse wheel triggers too quickly, or the mouse wheel causes your computer to lag or beep, increasing this value appropriately can solve the problem.

### Disabled App List (Pro)

When the apps in the list are in the foreground, OneQuick will not listen to keyboard and mouse events.

For example, setting it to some games can prevent OneQuick functions from being accidentally triggered in these games.
